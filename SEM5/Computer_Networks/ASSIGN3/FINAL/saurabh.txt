Hello , this is the test packet for the assignment in which is to be converted into frames of size 512 bits 
which is the standard ethernet packet size .Then that packet must be sent to the channel in which error is to be 
injected which is further sent to the server .The protocols used are Stop N Wait , Go Back N and 
Selective Repeat Protocol .These protocols are to be used for sending the data packets and according to the 
various algorithms we need to ensure the resending of the unacknowledged packet..
